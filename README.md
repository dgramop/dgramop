Hi! I'm Dhruv.

I'm interested in (software-defined) radio, embedded systems, Rust, sensor fusion, additive manufacturing, and code-generation. I have emerging interests in CAD/CAM software, as a user and as a developer. I have skills but  slightly fading interests in cybersecurity (web exploitation), networking, and web development.

Open to in-person meetings with open-source developers and users in the bay area and nor. cal!
