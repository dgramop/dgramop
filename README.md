Hi! I'm Dhruv.

I'm interested in (software-defined) radio, sensors + embedded systems, Rust, additive manufacturing, and geometry. I have emerging interests in CAD/CAM software, as a user and as a developer. I have skills but  slightly fading interests in cybersecurity (web exploitation), networking, and web development.

Open to in-person meetings with open-source developers and users in the OC/socal
